# Queue System Description
<br>

## Purpose:
The queue system is designed to efficiently handle and process high volumes of sensor data from multiple sources, such as wheel sensors, LiDAR, cameras, and other monitoring devices equipped on the self-driving robot. Its primary function is to ensure data is collected, queued, and processed in a way that maximizes responsiveness and minimizes processing delays in real-time operations.

## Functionality
 - **Data Collection:** The system collects data from various sensors integrated into the robot. This includes motion data, environmental data, and navigational data, which are crucial for the robot's operation and decision-making processes.
 - **Asynchronous Queuing:** Once data is collected, it is sent to a message queue. 
This queuing mechanism allows the system to handle large amounts of data without blocking the sensors or the data collection processes. 
It ensures that incoming data is not lost and is handled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.
 - **Data Processing:** Data stored in the queue is processed by dedicated worker processes or services. 
These workers pull data from the queue as soon as they are available and process it based on predefined algorithms and logic. 
The processing might involve data analysis, decision-making support, and sending commands back to the robotâ€™s control systems.
 - **Scalability and Reliability:** The queue system is scalable, capable of handling increases in data volume without significant changes to the infrastructure. 
It is also designed to be reliable, ensuring data integrity and consistent processing even under high loads or when facing potential system failures.
